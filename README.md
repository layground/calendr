## About The Project

Calendr aims to provide a clean, centralized, and easy-to-access view of important dates in Indonesia. Instead of searching through multiple sources, users can find official national holidays and curated local cultural events in one place. The app is designed to be lightweight and performant, leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering.

### Key Features

- **National Holiday Display**: Shows the official list of Indonesian public holidays (`Hari Libur Nasional`) and joint leave days (`Cuti Bersama`).
- **Local Event Exploration**: Browse major local events, festivals, and celebrations for specific regions like Yogyakarta and Surabaya.
- **Structured JSON Data**: All event and holiday data is sourced from well-structured JSON files, making contributions and maintenance straightforward.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript for a robust and scalable foundation.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family.
